# Which are the useful files?

  - CO2_CH4.m gives an example of RRR slow-fast CO2-CH4 refraction polars.
  - CO2_CH4_sys_limits.m plots the refraction system boundaries. It compares results to an article's data, stored in the article_syst_lims.txt file:
    - The execution takes a while so plots were stored in system_bounds_CO2_CH4 and system_bounds_CO2_CH4_comp ".fig" files.
    - CO2_CH4_data.mat also contains the matlab variables from a previous computation.
