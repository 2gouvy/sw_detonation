# What does each file represent?

- Ar_to_He_sys_limits.m plots the refraction system boundaries. It compares results to simulation results stored in the Ar_to_He_sim_results_data.m file.
- The execution takes a while so plots were stored in the system_bounds_Ar_to_He".fig" file.
- Ar_to_He_sys_limits_data.mat also contains the matlab variables from a previous computation.
