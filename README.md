# sw_detonation
This is a git repo for shock wave detonation project at Tsinghua University.


## Usage
###### Note: Before using, make sure that the "/src" folder is in the matlab path.
The "/examples" folder contains examples for basic use. In short:

  - plot_example.m gives an example of how to plot one polar.
  - multiple_polar_example.m gives an example of how to plot more than one polar.
  - CO2_CH4.m gives an example of RRR slow-fast CO2-CH4 refraction polars.
  - CO2_CH4_sys_limits.m plots the refraction system boundaries. It compares results to an article's data, stored in the article_syst_lims.txt file. The execution takes a while so results were stored system_bounds_CO2_CH4 and system_bounds_CO2_CH4_comp files.

## Polar source codes
Some polars on which we focused on grouped in the "/polar_src" folder
