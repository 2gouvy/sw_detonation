  - multiple_polar_example.m gives an example of how to plot more than one polar
  - CO2_CH4.m gives an example of RRR slow-fast CO2-CH4 refraction polars
  - CO2_CH4_sys_limits.m plots different system boundaries

## Polar source codes
Some polars on which we focused on grouped in the "/polar_src" folder
