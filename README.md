This is a git repo for the shock wave detonation project at Tsinghua University.

## Usage
###### Note: Before using, make sure that the "/src" folder is in the matlab path.
The "/examples" folder contains examples for basic use. In short:
  - polar_plotting contains polar plotting examples
  - CO2_to_CH4 contains plots for CO2->CH4 refraction, including refraction system limits.
  - lag_particle_rre contains plots of theoretical evolutions of Lagrangian particles in an RRE pattern.

## Plot source codes
Some plots on which we focused on are grouped in the "/plots_src" folder.
